### audio-sample-v3

**Ground Truth:**
```
Alright so... I'm at the grocery store at like 2 AM because that's apparently when I do my shopping now.
And this guy in the cereal aisle is just staring at the Cheerios. Like, REALLY staring.
For probably ten minutes. I circle back three times and he's still there.
So finally I'm like, "Hey man, you good?"
And he turns to me, dead serious, and goes, "Do you think bees know we made a cereal about them?"
I... I didn't know what to say to that.
So I just grabbed a box of Froot Loops and started backing away slowly.
But THEN—he follows me to the checkout and gets in line behind me.
We're both just standing there in silence.
The cashier rings up my stuff, and as I'm leaving he calls out:
"They deserve royalties, you know. The bees."
I haven't been back to that store since.
Pretty sure he's still there, fighting for bee rights in the cereal aisle at 2 AM.

Pretty sure he's still there, fighting for b-rights in the serial aisle at 2am.
