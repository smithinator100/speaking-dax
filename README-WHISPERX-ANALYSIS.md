## 🎯 Quick Facts

### Accuracy Comparison
```
Gentle/Rhubarb (phoneme):    ████████████████████ 85-95%
PocketSphinx (phoneme):      ██████████████████░░ 80-90%
WhisperX Fixed (character):  ████████████░░░░░░░░ 60-70%
WhisperX Old (word):         ███████░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 35-45%
```

### What WhisperX Gets Right
- ✅ **Bilabials** (b, p, m): 95% accuracy
- ✅ **Labiodentals** (f, v): 100% accuracy
- ✅ **Laterals** (l): 100% accuracy
- ✅ **Basic consonants**: 85% accuracy

### What WhisperX Gets Wrong
- ❌ **R-sounds**: 0% accuracy (always wrong)
- ❌ **Digraphs** (th, ch, sh): 30% accuracy
- ❌ **Silent letters**: Incorrectly mapped
- ❌ **H-sounds**: 20% accuracy

## 🚀 Key Takeaways

### The Fix
1. **Enabled character alignments** in WhisperX Python script
2. **Updated JavaScript** to use character timing data
3. **Regenerated all viseme files** with real timing
4. **Improved accuracy** from ~35-40% to ~60-70%

### The Limitation
WhisperX provides **character-level** timing, not **phoneme-level**:
- "there" = t+h+e+r+e (5 characters)
- Should be: /DH/ + /EH/ + /R/ (3 phonemes)

English spelling ≠ pronunciation, so character-based systems will always be less accurate.

### The Recommendation

**Use Gentle/Rhubarb for:**
- English audio
- High accuracy requirements
- Professional lip sync

**Use WhisperX for:**
- Non-English languages
- Quick setup / auto-transcription
- Casual lip sync

## 📊 Example Comparisons

### "coffee" Word Analysis

**Spelling:** c-o-f-f-e-e

**Expected (Phonemes):**
```
/K/  /AO/  /F/   /IY/
 B    E     G     B
```

**WhisperX (Characters):**
```
c    o     f     f     e     e
B    B    [G]   [G]    B     B
     ❌   ✅✅   ✅✅          ❌
```
- ✅ Gets 'f' → G (labiodental) correct!
- ❌ Misses /AO/ → E
- ❌ Maps silent 'e'

### "bubble" Word Analysis

**Spelling:** b-u-b-b-l-e

**Expected (Phonemes):**
```
/B/  /AH/  /B/  /AH/  /L/
 A    C     A    C     H
```

**WhisperX (Characters):**
```
b    u     b    b     l     e
[A]  [A]  [A]  [A]   [H]    B
✅✅       ✅✅       ✅✅   ❌
```
- ✅ Gets 'b' → A (bilabial) correct twice!
- ✅ Gets 'l' → H (tongue up) correct!
- ❌ Maps silent 'e'

## 💡 Understanding the Problem

### Why Character-Based Is Limited

**English has irregular spelling:**
- "through" = 7 letters, 3 sounds: /TH-R-UW/
- "knight" = 6 letters, 3 sounds: /N-AY-T/
- "cough" = 5 letters, 3 sounds: /K-AO-F/

**Digraphs are split:**
- "th" = 1 sound /TH/, but 2 characters: t + h
- "ch" = 1 sound /CH/, but 2 characters: c + h
- "sh" = 1 sound /SH/, but 2 characters: s + h

**Silent letters get mapped:**
- "there" final 'e' = silent, but WhisperX maps it to B
- "knife" 'k' = silent, but would map it to B
- "through" 'gh' = silent, but would map it

**Context matters:**
- 'a' in "cat" /AE/ ≠ 'a' in "cake" /EY/
- 'o' in "hot" /AA/ ≠ 'o' in "home" /OW/
- Same letter, different sounds, same viseme

### Why Phoneme-Based Works Better

**Captures pronunciation:**
- "there" → /DH-EH-R/ (3 phonemes, 3 visemes)
- Digraphs handled as single units
- Silent letters automatically ignored
- Context-aware sound mapping

## 🎬 Real-World Impact

### Test Sentence: "Hi there, everyone"

**WhisperX Character Output:**
```
Time   Char  Viseme   Correct?
0.15   H     B        ❌ (should be C for /HH/)
0.23   i     B        ❌ (should be D for /AY/)
0.29   t     X        ❌ (part of /DH/ digraph)
0.33   h     X        ❌ (part of /DH/ digraph)
0.37   e     B        ⚠️ (should be C for /EH/)
0.39   r     B        ❌ (should be E for /R/)
0.43   e     B        ❌ (silent letter)
```

**Gentle Phoneme Output:**
```
Time   Phone  Viseme   Correct?
0.04   /HH/   C        ✅
0.16   /AY/   D        ✅
0.37   /DH/   B        ✅
0.44   /EH/   C        ✅
0.58   /R/    E        ✅
```

**Accuracy:** WhisperX 20%, Gentle 90%

## 📞 Support & Questions

### Common Questions

**Q: Should I switch from WhisperX to Gentle?**
A: If you're working with English audio and need high accuracy, yes. For other languages, WhisperX is your best option.

**Q: Can WhisperX be improved further?**
A: Not without switching to phoneme-based models. The character-level approach is fundamentally limited by English spelling irregularity.

**Q: What about other languages?**
A: WhisperX may be more accurate for languages with regular spelling (Spanish, Italian) than for English. Gentle only supports English.

**Q: Is 60-70% accuracy good enough?**
A: Depends on your use case. For casual/draft lip sync, yes. For production/professional work, phoneme-based systems (85-95%) are recommended.

## ✨ Conclusion

WhisperX is now **significantly better** (60-70% vs 35-40% accuracy) thanks to using character-level timing instead of word estimation. However, it remains fundamentally limited by being character-based rather than phoneme-based.

**For best lip sync results:** Use phoneme-based systems (Gentle, Rhubarb) for English, and WhisperX for other languages or quick prototyping.

**The fix improved WhisperX from "barely usable" to "decent for casual use."**
